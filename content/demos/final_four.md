# March Madness Final Four

After the bracket comes out on selection Sunday, the first and second question most people will ask you when comparing brackets is “Who is your national champion?” and “Who is in your final four?” Below is the sims 20 most common final fours. All of them have at least seeds one number one seed most of them at least 2. Notably the most common final four is all four one seeds happening a little over 8% of the time which is about 4 times more than it was projected last year. The one seeds are extremely powerful this year and if the sims are suggesting anything it is that we could have only all one seeds in the final four for the first time since 2008 and only second time ever. 

Included on this page is also a ‘Final Four Finder”. You can enter one to four teams and it will find the most common final fours with the selected teams.
