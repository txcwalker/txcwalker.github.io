Below is a table with the odds for every Team to make it to the following rounds Sweet Sixteen, Elite Eight, Final Four and Championship Winner. Simpley Select which team(s) you would like to view and hit "Show Selected Teams". Please keep in mind that these odds will not perfectly match Vegas. These odds are calculated on 10,000 tournaments being simulate and each teams placements being summed. So there can only every be 10,000 championship winners, 40,000 Final Four teams, etc etc. So if a team never makes it to a round in the tournament they have functionally +infinity odds and if they are winning 1000 of the 10000 times they have a probabiltiy of 10% which translates to 9/1 or +900. Las Vegas odds do not operate this way, it is close but not exact they are not in the business of correct predictins (sort of it is more complicated than that and something out of the scope of this discussion).
