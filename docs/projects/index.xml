      <title>Phishing Prediction</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project first started out as me getting a phishing message on LinkedIn. I was annoyed that I got my hopes up, however brief, and realized that I could probably make some sort of model to evaluate if messages were sent with benevolent or malign intent. After doing a bit of research, testing and finally some coding I was able to get a model and app (check that out here “ (&lt;a href=&#34;https://gonephishing.streamlit.app&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;https://gonephishing.streamlit.app&lt;/a&gt;) ”).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Every March college basketball captures the Country’s countries imagination. The tournament begins with 68 teams each of whom believe they can win the tournament and be crowned the best college basketball team in the country. The single elimination, win or go home, style of tournament creates excitement because anything can happen in one game. And it is true, anything can happen in one game. But what is the likelihood? Part of the reason this tournament has gained its fame is in pursuit of the perfect bracket. Correctly picking all 63 games, Warren Buffet has famously offered a substantial cash prize to the first person who can fill out a perfect bracket. Despite millions of attempts each year no one has really come close. So how can we try to be perfect? How can we get as close as possible? Realistically the perfect bracket is never going to happen but chasing it will also keep us entertained.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made an app that gives users the ability to query a real-time relational database of baseball statistics. This all started when a friend of mine expressed frustration that a tool like this did not exist. He asked me to make it my next project — and so I did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel I was able to produce something that is really interesting and useful (if you’re into baseball). But before getting into the end product, I’d like to discuss the setup and process that led to it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Yelp Introduction</title>
      <link>https://txcwalker.github.io/projects/yelpzillow/</link>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an introduction to the analysis done on Yelp included on this site. It goes over some of the difficulties of the data as well as providing a brief overview of the process
taken to construct the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Yelp API has its positives and negatives. It is relatively easy to get access and get started using. There are plenty of pages of documentation on how to use the API and its limitations. In its most basic form, it is a solid source of data from Yelp. These positives should not be understated; it is important that public data be easily available to the public. However, there are some negatives I would like to point out that I think should be addressed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
