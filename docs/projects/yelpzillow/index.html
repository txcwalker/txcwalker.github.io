        </div>

        

        
        <div class="post-content" id="post-content">
          <h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>This is an introduction to the analysis done on Yelp included on this site. It goes over some of the difficulties of the data as well as providing a brief overview of the process
taken to construct the project.</p>
<p>The Yelp API has its positives and negatives. It is relatively easy to get access and get started using. There are plenty of pages of documentation on how to use the API and its limitations. In its most basic form, it is a solid source of data from Yelp. These positives should not be understated; it is important that public data be easily available to the public. However, there are some negatives I would like to point out that I think should be addressed.</p>
<h3 id="ratings">Ratings</h3>
<p>This is by far the biggest issue with the API. The ratings are rounded to the nearest half (4.3 is rounded to 4.5 and 4.2 is rounded to 4, etc.). Why? This leads to a lot of information being lost and greatly skews the mean and median (median now has an even more limited number of options). The stars are surely just an average of the ratings, so why are there only 9 options instead of the 400 possible if it were set to two decimal places? The information is already easily available and displayed on the site to one decimal place. What is being gained by sacrificing the accuracy of the rating to people looking at the data?</p>
<h3 id="odd-observations">Odd Observations</h3>
<p>During the data acquisition process for this project, the API called US cities. Several non-US countries showed up. In some cases, this makes a lot of sense with Detroit, El Paso, and San Diego being large cities on international borders. It is expected to see some spillover as the cities on the other side of the border (Windsor, Juarez, and Tijuana) are only different names because of some arbitrary line. However, getting results for Argentina, Malaysia, the Philippines, etc., is bizarre. Again, it is easy to filter these out, but what were they doing there in the first place?</p>
<p>As an example:</p>




  
  
  
  
    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr><th>Country</th><th>Name</th><th>Price</th><th>Rating</th><th>Review Count</th><th>State</th><th>Zip Code</th></tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody><tr><td>VI</td><td>Kokonut Grill</td><td>2</td><td>4</td><td>363</td><td>VA</td><td>23220</td></tr></tbody>
    </table>
  


<p>Where Virginia (VA) is listed as a state of the Virgin Islands (VI). All of the other information is correct: the zip code, coordinates, address. So why and how did the Virgin Islands end up as the country? As mentioned, these observations are easy enough to filter out. The reason it is a problem is because it is unclear whether the data observed in these is mislabeled on the front or back end (maybe both). Are these legitimate observations that should be included in the analysis? Or did these observations somehow slip through the cracks and should they be ignored? For this analysis, the latter was chosen.</p>
<h3 id="mismatching-columns">Mismatching Columns</h3>
<p>This is a quality of life issue. For the most part, all of the columns came in the same order when using the API. However, in about 25% of cases, the price column was moved from being 7th in the table to second to last. Most cities had it 7th, but there were plenty of cities which had it in the second to last position. For example, San Antonio and Houston both had it second to last, but Dallas had it in its normal 7th position. Nashville had it second to last, but Memphis had its normal 7th position. San Francisco had it 7th and San Diego had it second to last. You get the idea. There was seemingly no way to predict which cities would be in which format. It was not by state, latitude, or longitude. The unpredictability is frustrating and makes this more difficult for the end user, especially for beginners.</p>
<h3 id="api-limitations">API Limitations</h3>
<p>The last point to be addressed about this project’s interaction with the Yelp API is the limitations. This is not a criticism of the API, rather a statement on the dataset that was formed from the collection process. On the “standard” version of the API, there is a limitation to the number of ‘calls’ that can be made to the API. Essentially, one computer can only make so many requests in a day/month so it does not crash the entire system. Makes sense; this is great on many levels. What is a bit more bizarre is there is no way (at least that was found for this project) to pick up at the last save point from the data retrieval. Take New York for example. The API is called and run for the first X (say 2000) observations. This data is received, saved, and processed. However, trying to get the next 2000 observations proved to be difficult. In fact, it was not able to be done. Impossible? Probably not, but many different approaches were tried and none of them were successful. All of this is to say this dataset is comprised of the first X amount of observations from each city that was called.</p>
<p>Again, nothing is perfect; no one is expecting this. Most of this data is scrapped from each vendor&rsquo;s website and if it is copied as it appears exactly. However, from an ease of use and analysis perspective, these are a few things that can be relatively easily cleaned up. In an ideal world, APIs could be used by anyone, not just those who can code.</p>
<h1 id="search-score">Search Score</h1>
<p>After using Yelp to find the best restaurants ‘near me’ for more than a decade, I have seen a decline in the accuracy and validity of their search algorithm. Too often the search results seemed random and incomplete. So after years of confusion, I finally decided to try and take a look under the hood. See if I could understand their search algorithm and results. Then finally take a stab at my own search algorithm and see how closely my results compare to Yelp&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>This started by using the Yelp API and accessing as much data as possible. The API has daily call limit (about 10 max calls) and a call limit of about 2000 observations per call. So after gathering data over several weeks, the dataset was defined. After cleaning close to 100,000 total observations from over 50 major metropolitan areas around the United States. This is a small percentage of the total observations that Yelp has but it is big enough to run an analysis on, develop a model, and evaluate the results to form a few conclusions on the overall validity of both search algorithms.</p>
<p>When accessing data from the Yelp API, there are plenty of variables that can be selected to accompany each observation. For the purposes of this discussion, there are two: Number of Reviews and Rating. With just these two variables, we should be able to understand the current Yelp algorithm and create a close replica of it as long as the current search algorithm is relatively unbiased.</p>
<p>Let’s start with creating a version of Yelp&rsquo;s search algorithm. It should show the user the best restaurants near them in an objective, unbiased order. The metric should rate the restaurant’s quality and have some verification component. The two variables mentioned earlier (Reviews and Rating) are a perfect and concise way to accomplish this task. The Rating is the measure of quality (on a scale of 1-5, where 5 is best) and the Number of Reviews is an easy way to verify the rating; the more reviews a place has, the more accurate the rating.</p>
<p>It would be a dream to be able to multiply these numbers together, arrive at a score, and then sort our results on this number, but the scales of these numbers prevent this from being accurate. The Number of Reviews would have significantly more impact; imagine the following example:</p>
<p>Recommendation Score = Rating * Number of Reviews</p>
<p>Restaurant Score 1 = 5 * 50 = 250</p>
<p>Restaurant Score 2 = 4 * 100 = 400</p>
<p>Obviously, Restaurant 1 should have a way higher ranking, but it is nearly half of Restaurant 2. To accommodate for this, each number will be scaled in the following way. The Rating is the most important part of evaluating the restaurant. Lower values should be punished and higher values should be rewarded, so this number will be squared. As for the Number of Reviews, this is important but after a certain amount of reviews, the rating is going to become stable. So this number is important but should have diminishing returns. A perfect way to scale this down is a log function, in this case, the natural log. The scaling can be seen below, and now the algorithm is as follows:</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation Score = Rating <sup>2</sup> * ln(Number of Reviews)</strong></p>
<!-- x vs ln(x) -->




  
  
  
  
    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr><th>ln(x)</th><th>x</th></tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody><tr><td>0</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>2.302585</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>4.60517</td><td>100</td></tr><tr><td>6.907755</td><td>1000</td></tr></tbody>
    </table>
  


<!-- x vs x2 -->




  
  
  
  
    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr><th>x</th><th>x2</th></tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>1.5</td><td>2.25</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>2.5</td><td>6.25</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>3.5</td><td>12.25</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>16</td></tr><tr><td>4.5</td><td>20.25</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>25</td></tr></tbody>
    </table>
  


<p>Now that we have a simple version of how a search score and recommendation algorithm looks, let&rsquo;s test it out and evaluate both it and the version that Yelp uses!</p>
<!-- Example -->




  
  
  
  
    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr><th>City</th><th>Top Ten Percentage</th><th>Zip Code</th></tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody><tr><td>Downtown LA</td><td>10%</td><td>90013</td></tr></tbody>
    </table>
  


<p>A couple of quick notes before the conclusions. First, a reminder, as the API only gave the rating in half-number intervals. So the Wurstkuche is rounded down from 4.2 to 4.0. Additionally, there is a small difference in the number of reviews for Wurstkuche because these results were not taken at the same time (few days difference). The Green Highlighted observation is what both models agree on, the purple highlighted observations are ones that would be in the model&rsquo;s top ten if they were in the data set and red highlighted observations are red flags.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this is not a one-off occurrence. This was the case for all of the zip codes researched. Below is the same search functionality used to create the model’s top ten list. Go ahead and select any zip code from the dropdown and compare it to the Yelp Results. Obviously, not every zip code was checked. There are over 2000 of them in the data set, and if the researched ones are the outliers, then that is great! But if you don’t believe me, try for yourself at the bottom of the page. Pick any zip code, then run a Yelp search using the recommended search setting and compare it to the results that appear on this page!</p>
<p>So where did the model go wrong? It is only getting two pieces of information versus the tens if not hundreds the Yelp algorithm uses. Of the two pieces of information, it is getting one of them (the one more heavily weighted in the model) has significant information loss because it is rounded (no idea why it is still transmitting the same amount of information one place past the decimal).</p>
<p>The biggest place of improvement for the model is the number of reviews itself. After a certain number of reviews, there is going to be no real change in the restaurant’s rating. There is some critical number of reviews where, for the sake of the math, they become irrelevant. What new information is being communicated from review 1000 to 2000 or 3000 to 5000? Where is that critical mass point? It is probably different for every restaurant. Some generalization should be made, maybe at 1000, but more research would be required to know. However, it is possible that the excess reviews are communicating something outside of the rating. For example, maybe the restaurant has a unique concept which makes the experience one of a kind? Or perhaps this is the first/only restaurant of a certain cuisine in a city and while the rating is stable, it is something worth trying.</p>
<p>On Yelp’s end, how is it that in the top ten for one of many zip codes in Downtown Los Angeles, there are three restaurants with 60 or fewer reviews and two with fewer than 15? Are some reviews worth more than others? Does the location of the search or location of the zip code influence the type of restaurant that will show up in searches? For example, part of this zip code is an area known as Little Tokyo, so are Japanese restaurants more likely to populate? Are the searches considering data from the user&rsquo;s computer? For example, when these searches were run across multiple accounts and web browsers, different results were seen. There is no guarantee that the person running the Yelp search is the same person who uses the device most of the time. Accounts/computers are often shared between families, kids, couples, roommates, companies, etc. Is there a point where a review is no longer used in the algorithm? For example, if a review was left longer than x years ago, is it disregarded by the algorithm? If so, then why does it still show on the site if it is not being used? Is there marketing being considered by the search? Are these three restaurants prolific advertisers on social media or elsewhere, which is being considered by the algorithm? A most recommended list should surely be agnostic of advertising and marketing.</p>
<p>Both algorithms have their strengths and weaknesses. Clearly, neither is perfect and both are in need of improvement, which makes sense, as it is difficult to quantify human preferences when each of us has a slightly different opinion. The best algorithm probably lies somewhere in between the simple model created here and the more complex version Yelp has been using.</p>

<h1 id="zillow-analysis">Zillow Analysis</h1>
<h2 id="housing-price-prediction">Housing Price Prediction</h2>
<p>This analysis was motivated by the following question: Can the collected data from Yelp be used to approximate the average housing price of a zip code?</p>
<p>Data was collected from Yelp using its API and a model was created to try and predict the average cost of a house by zip code. If the model shows promise, it can be used to help predict future changes in housing price as the average price/rating/review count of a zip code&rsquo;s restaurants increase or decrease. This could help with improving city logistics, ease gentrification, provide investing opportunities, and much more. The core idea is popular restaurants could be a proxy variable representing an increase in interest in a particular area and thus an increase in the average price of housing.</p>
<h2 id="data-constraints">Data Constraints</h2>
<p>The Yelp API, like most APIs, limits the number of times it can be &ldquo;called&rdquo; (data can be retrieved) in 24 hours. By data standards, a relatively limited amount can be called per day, say 5000 observations, which seems like a lot. However, after cleaning the data (removing observations with too few reviews or that is missing important data, duplicates, irrelevant data, etc.), the number of clean observations obtained daily comes down significantly. After collecting data over the combined time span of 6 weeks, there are only about 80,000 total observations with about 2100 of the over 41000 unique zip codes represented in the data. Once the data was further cleaned and combined with the Zillow data, there were exactly 2000 zip codes tested by the model. This is only about 5% of the total zip codes in the US. Additionally, not every restaurant on Yelp is in this data set, including some of the most popular, highly reviewed/rated restaurants in every city.</p>
<p>So the goal of the model is to try and help predict housing prices. If it is possible to do this, the next step would be to use the data to forecast future housing prices based on changes in the restaurant scene of a city.</p>
<h2 id="variables">Variables</h2>
<p>There are many variables to choose from and plenty more that would be useful but are inaccessible. Variables from both the Yelp data set and the Zillow data set were used. Below is a list of the variables and a brief description.</p>
<h3 id="yelp">Yelp</h3>
<p><strong>Number of Reviews</strong> - How many reviews an individual restaurant has received. Presumably, the reviews are monitored by Yelp and any obviously fake/bot reviews (overtly positive or negative) are removed and not considered by any part of the process on Yelp. The average, median, and sum of the number of reviews for a zip code are used in the model.</p>
<p><strong>Rating</strong> - On the Yelp search page, this is a number in the form X.Y in a range from 1 to 5, with 1.0 being the worst and 5.0 being the best. Data received from the API limits the output to whole numbers and their halves. For example, 4.2 is rounded down to 4 and 4.3 is rounded up to 4.5. This means there are only 9 possibilities for rating, which results in a massive loss of information. The average and median rating are used in the model.</p>
<p><strong>Price</strong> - This is a pretty imprecise measurement. Yelp uses dollar signs ($) to measure the price, and the only options are $, $$, $$$, $$$$ from cheapest to most expensive. What the measurement lacks in precision it makes up for in simplicity. The average and median rating are used in the model.</p>
<h3 id="zillow">Zillow</h3>
<p><strong>Price</strong> - The average price of a house in a given zip code.</p>
<p><strong>City</strong> - City in which the zip code is located.</p>
<p><strong>State</strong> - State in which the zip code is located.</p>
<p><strong>Metro</strong> - Greater Metro area in which the zip code is located.</p>
<h2 id="creating-the-model">Creating the Model</h2>
<p>There are many ways to analyze and learn about the relationships between multiple variables. Machine learning algorithms are quickly becoming the most popular. Some of these models are simple, while others are complex; all of them aim to try and quantify the relationship between the chosen variables and hopefully better explain the world around us.</p>
<p>Machine learning can be broken down several ways. There are plenty of options to choose from when choosing a model type, and new options are constantly being introduced into the community. The model chosen to examine this data set is a random forest. There are pros and cons to every approach. Before discussing these, here is a quick description of a random forest.</p>
<p>There is a simpler machine learning technique called &ldquo;decision trees.&rdquo; A random forest is a collection of these trees analyzed together to reach a conclusion. A decision tree is similar to a game of twenty questions, where the computer is asked a yes or no question, and depending on the answer, a path (branch) is formed until the computer arrives at a final answer. This process is repeated multiple times until algorithm is confident in where a given branch will lead.</p>
<p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:720/format:webp/1*E2br87UjCErSE2eqJ56DWQ.png" alt="Decision Tree"></p>
<p>In the above example, if x(0) is less than or equal to 5.5, the tree goes left; otherwise, it goes right. If it goes left, it arrives at its final answer. If it goes right, it asks another yes or no question (less than or equal to 11.5) and then arrives at its answer. This branching process is done as many times as needed (based on the number of variables) until each branch reaches an endpoint.</p>
<p>The benefits of using a random forest include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Good with non-linear relationships</li>
<li>Good for higher-dimensional space (good with lots of variables)</li>
<li>Not prone to overfitting</li>
<li>Feature scaling generally not needed</li>
<li>Feature importance can be obtained</li>
</ul>
<p>The cons to using a random forest are as follows but in this case the pros outweigh the cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>For large data sets, it can be resource-intensive (only 2000 observations for this data set)</li>
<li>It is a &ldquo;black box model,&rdquo; making it more difficult to understand the decision-making process</li>
<li>Random forests are known as &ldquo;greedy algorithms,&rdquo; meaning they can&rsquo;t see past the two options in front of them when faced with a decision. So it will choose the better path based on the options immediately in front of it and not necessarily the best overall option</li>
</ul>
<p>The variables in the model are listed above, with Zillow Price being the dependent variable (what is being predicted). The data set is relatively small, so the model was trained on 75% of the data set (exactly 1500 observations) and tested on the remaining 500 observations. As a reminder, this data set consists of 2000 rows of summary statistics (mostly averages and medians), with about 80,000 Yelp observations funneling into 2000 unique zip codes.</p>
<h2 id="evaluating-the-model">Evaluating the Model</h2>
<p>Two of the more common  quantitative evaluation techniques for random forests are: Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R<sup>2</sup> (coefficient of determination). MSE measures the average difference between the true and predicted values by the model, squared to make it positive and to more heavily penalize extreme misses. The squares are then summed and averaged to produce the final MSE. R<sup>2</sup> provides a numerical value between 0 and 1, indicating how much of the variance in the dependent variable is explained by the independent variables.</p>
<p><strong>Mean Squared Error (MSE):</strong> 80,007,257,500.25774<br>
<strong>R <sup>2</sup>&gt;:</strong> 0.5229242919073203</p>
<p>The MSE initially appears quite high, and the square root of this number, $282,855.54, is still concerning. Several factors may contribute to this, which will be discussed later.</p>
<p>The R<sup>2</sup> is actually quite adequate approaching good. For a real-world scenario, having more than half the variance in housing prices explained by the mostly Yelp data provided is encouraging for the prospect of the model moving forward.</p>
<p>As mentioned, random forests are black box models, making it challenging to understand exactly what the model is &ldquo;thinking&rdquo; or what is happening in its decision-making process. Fortunately, there are tools that provide some insights into how it arrived at its conclusions.</p>
<p>Two types of residual analysis were conducted to examine where the model was most and least accurate. The first shows the True vs. Predicted values, and the second shows the differences by index.</p>
<p>The following graph indicates that the model is relatively accurate when the average house price is less than $750,000. There is a breakdown from $750,000 to $1.00MM, and anything after that is problematic. The model never predicts anything over $1.76MM, and only one other prediction exceeds $1.5MM. It struggles with higher-priced houses while being relatively accurate with lower-priced houses.</p>
<p><img src="/images/Housing_Price/True_vs_Prediction_YelpZillow_HousingPrice.png" alt="True vs Prediction"></p>
<p>Since the model loses accuracy as the price of houses increases, it significantly hinders its ability to predict increasing housing prices based on Yelp activity (recall that is the end goal). This is reinforced by the seemingly hard cap at around $1.75MM. By placing lines at y and x = 750K, the graph looks like the following:</p>
<p><img src="/images/Housing_Price/True_vs_Prediction_YelpZillow_HousingPrice_GreenLines.png" alt="True vs Prediction with Green Lines"></p>
<p>The table below details the number of points in each of the quadrants in the above graph.</p>




  
  
  
  
    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr><th>Number of Points</th><th>Percentage</th><th>Quadrant</th></tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody><tr><td>380</td><td>76%</td><td>Bottom Left</td></tr><tr><td>23</td><td>4.6%</td><td>Bottom Right</td></tr><tr><td>36</td><td>7.2%</td><td>Top Left</td></tr><tr><td>61</td><td>12.2%</td><td>Top Right</td></tr></tbody>
    </table>
  


<p>This is another encouraging sign. If the model can be better trained for more expensive houses, then potentially it can have applications.</p>
<p>This second residual analysis shows the differences (residuals) by index number, and it looks pretty good. A decent portion of the differences are within the absolute value of 200K, and nearly all of them are within 400K. It is, of course, by no means ideal, but it is a place to start. The remaining 25 outliers are what are really punishing the MSE (as they should).</p>
<p><img src="/images/Housing_Price/ResidualAnalysisRFR_YelpZillow_HousingPrice.png" alt="Residual Analysis"></p>
<p>This, in conjunction with the True vs. Predict value graph, shows that the model is almost being double punished by the outliers and might be suffering from overfitting. The outliers have massive squared errors which contribute to the high MSE. Additionally, it seems the model has a cap at 1.75M and is more reluctant to guess increasingly high numbers. So, the issue that needs to be solved is accuracy for more expensive houses.</p>
<p>The final piece of visualization is looking at which variables the model most highly prioritized when using the data to predict housing price. In the graph below, no one variable has a dominant percentage.</p>
<p><img src="/images/Housing_Price/Feature_Importantce_RFR_YelpZillow_HousingPrice.png" alt="Feature Importance"></p>
<p>The mean number of reviews was the most important feature, but it capped out just above 25%, with two additional variables (review count median and mean price) coming in at just below 15%, and state coming in just behind the two of them at about 13%. These four variables are doing most of the work.</p>
<p>A bit surprising, challenging the initial thought process behind the idea that spurred this analysis, is that restaurant rating looks to be essentially useless in the model evaluation of relative importance. This could be due to the serious loss of information from the rounding when the data was received via the Yelp API. Even though these are averages and medians on a 1-5 scale, the small differences can make a big difference. In the downloaded data, 4.3 is viewed the same as 4.7, and there is a massive difference between 4.7 and 4.8 (4.5 vs 5.0). Orit might be too random to help with the prediction.</p>
<p>Here are three graphs to show the biggest misses, closest predictions, and the final one shows all of the data plotted on a map of the United States. The top map is all of the residuals plotted at the average coordinates of its zip code. The size and color scale with the size of the difference. The color scale is pictured on the right, and as the circles get bigger, so does the size of the miss. Size scale is based on the absolute value, so negative values are not the smallest.</p>

<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>There is some promise to this model. It definitely is not perfect due to the combination of skewed data and the overall lack of data. It is unclear how much of the total Yelp data is included in the data set, but it is surely less than 10% and probably significantly less than that. Only 2000 of the 41,000 US zip codes are included. So, there is room for significant improvement in this department. Unfortunately, it is easy to identify this problem but not so easy to rectify.</p>
<p>A 52% R<sup>2</sup> is not bad on its own, and with all of the learnings from this process, it is encouraging for the next steps that can be taken with a more complete version of the data set. Of course, it can be improved, and the change in these variables can be monitored month to month to help predict a change in housing price. This data has plenty of use cases, many of which have not been conceived.</p>
<p>The biggest roadblock to the model is its performance for the more expensive housing prices. Obviously, more data would help, but based on its sporadic performance when the price was greater than 750K, there need to be more adjustments to help this part of the model. The data might respond better to a different type of analysis, or maybe just the housing prices greater than 750K (or some other value) should be evaluated by a different model (sort of like a piecewise function). The analysis has shown that this is an idea worth pursuing, even if the initial thought behind using the Yelp data seems to be irrelevant.</p>
