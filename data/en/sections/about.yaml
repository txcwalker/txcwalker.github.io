summary: Hi, my name is Cam and I’m a data scientist. I believe every dataset has a story to tell if you ask the right questions. I specialize in translating real-world data into actionable insights using tools like Python, R, and SQL. I’ve analyzed climate trends, engineered predictive models, and even simulated March Madness to guide decision-making and maximize efficiency. At the same time, I enjoy building both creative and professional projects that make data approachable and fun. My goal is always the same; to create interactive solutions that are easy to understand and deliver real value.
