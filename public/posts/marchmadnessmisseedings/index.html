<p>It feels like every year the committee intentionally misseeds a couple of teams just to farm engagement and get people talking about the tournament. This year is unfortunately no different and perhaps even worse than most. Of course the primary body of work are the games you played in the regular season but that does not mean the conference tournaments should count for nothing. Below are the most egregious examples of teams that were over or underseeded.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Auburn: I get it they won the regular season SEC title, the strongest conference in college basketball this year and perhaps of any year. But they lost to Tennessee in the conference semifinals and Florida who is also a one seed and just as good as Auburn won the conference tournament. Additionally Duke was the number team in the country for the last month of the season. The differentiation between the regular season rankings and the tournament seeds is going to be a common theme here. Auburn is still a great team and no doubt deserving of a one seed. They could easily still win the entire thing but thye are definitely not the best team in the tournament.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Louisville: This one makes the least sense of anything to be addressed, ending the season as the tenth overall team in the country via the AP poll and only losing to Duke in the ACC conference tournament final. They beat Clemson twice who they have the same record as and Clemson got a 5 seed (which is a little under where they should have been). What we are going to see is that the SEC is going to have a lot of teams much much higher than they should because of the perceived strength of the conference. While it is true this was the best conference in college basketball in a long time, possibly ever, the middling and bottom team strengths being are inflated and carried by the strength of Auburn, Florida, Tennessee and Alabama.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kentucky: While they have some impressive wins this season they lost 11 games this year and ended the season 18th overall in the AP poll. They lost to Alabama 3 times including in the Conference tournament. Their early season win over Duke and there double over Tennessee in a two week time period is doing a lot of heavy lifting with this seeding. Troy is not joke and Kentucky lost their first round game to 14 seed Oakland last year. Do not be surprised by early exit from the Wildcats again this year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gonzaga and Saint Maryâ€™s: Both teams ended the season in the top 25 this year. Obviously they played in one of the weakest conferences in college basketball but they both played competitive non conference schedules. By nearly every advanced metric both of these teams are in the top 20 teams in the country with Gonzaga being close to the top 10. If Gonzaga did not have such a nasty potential second matchup against Houston they would be a favorite to make the final four as an non 1 or 2 seed. Even now they can still make a deep run.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Memphis: This is a team that ended the year in the top 25 for the AP, cruised through their conference and conference tournament. Played one of the best non conference schedules in the country, has wins over  Michigan State, Clemson, Ole Miss and UConn and is still drastically over seeded. They did everything they were suppose to but the advance metrics for this team fall extremely short. So short in fact that as 5 seed they are underdogs to 12 seed Colorado State. This is a team that sort of has to be a five seed based on their record but has the strength of an 8 or 9 seed, possibly lower.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="fairytales">Fairytales</h1>
<p>Every tournament has its over and underperformers. The teams that keep winning despite the odds (the cinderella stories) well overperformer their seed expectation and the teams that exit early (the frogs) despite their hype underperform their seed expectation. This metric comparing the average wins a team has in the simulated tournaments and comparing it to their seeds historical accomplishments. This information can be found here:</p>
<p><a href="https://bracketodds.cs.illinois.edu/seedadv.html">https://bracketodds.cs.illinois.edu/seedadv.html</a></p>
<p>These are some teams who are not winning or losing as often as their seed might suggest. Both of the below graphs synergize with the concepts we discussed earlier about the tournament being top heavy and top 30 being one of the best 30s in tournament history (except for maybe you Memphis) .</p>
<h2 id="underperformers">Underperformers</h2>
<p><img src="/images/March_Madness/underperformers.png" alt="Underperformers"></p>
<p>Speaking of which Memphis leads the way in underperforming as both Vegas and the Model used for the sims has Colorado St. favored in the games. A couple of other teams worth noting from the graph below.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Drake: This is a strong team. They only lost 3 games this year and have several power conference wins. However, their path is the most difficult of any 11 seed having to face the best 6 seed and then if they win potentially having to face the best 3 seed in the tournament. This is not a case of Drake not winning their first round game enough. This Drake not winning their sweet sixteen game enough. Historically 11 seeds win more games in the tournament than than both 9 and 10 seeds because they don&rsquo;t have to face a one or two in the next round. In fact of the Cinderella final four teams over the last decade there have been three 11 seeds to make it to the final four meanwhile only one 8, 9 and 10 seed have each made it respectively. This is a case of the model loving Missouri and Texas Tech not hating Drake.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Georgia: This is one of those weaker SEC teams that in a normal year probably wouldnt be in the tournament but the conference hype allowed them to sneak in and they got gifted a top ten advance metric team in Gonzaga. For an 8-9 matchup this as about as one sided as it gets With both Vegas and the model heavily favoring the Zags (-260 and -200 respectively)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>UC San Diego: This is a tough one. A team that sort of came out of nowhere but ranks relatively well for their weaker conference in the advanced metrics. Unfortunately they have to play a red hot Michigan team. This is one of the first round games where the model and Vegas are in a sizeable disagreement. Vegas has Michigan at -145 while the model has it a -300. This is a proceed with caution sign coming out from the model.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>On the flip side here are the projected overperformers for the tournament</p>
<h2 id="overperformers">Overperformers</h2>
<p><img src="/images/March_Madness/overperformers.png" alt="Overperformers"></p>
<p>Two of the five teams on this graph (Maryland and Colorado St.) are taking advantage of the fact that Memphis is one of the weakest single digit seeds in the tournament. Be careful with Maryland, they have potential sweet sixteen matchup with Florida where they would be +361 according to the model. However if they can win that game they would be favored against St Johnâ€™s and Missouri and slight underdogs against Texas Tech (+125) in a potential Elite 8 matchup. A couple of other teams worth calling out.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Missouri: We spoke briefly about them above in the context of their first round matchup with Drake the model loves this team relative to its seed being only slight underdogs against St. Johns, Texas Tech and Maryland while being significant favorites at -650 against Drake this outpaces the -275 line that Vegas currently is giving.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gonzaga: This is a case of the Bulldogs beating Georgia alot. We discussed them a bit already above and their story is similar to Marylandâ€™s just one round earlier. They have a tough potential matchup against Houston if they can beat Georgia but after that they are competitive with every other team in the region being favored over both Clemson and Purdue in a theoretical Sweet Sixteen game and only slight underdogs to both Kentucky and Illinois in an eventual Elite Eight (although Tennessee is heavily favored and most likely to get there).</p>
</li>
